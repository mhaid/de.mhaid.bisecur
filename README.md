# de.mhaid.hoermannbisecur

__App is still in Beta__

This app provides a connection to your Hörmann BiSecur gateway to monitor and control your BiSecur Hörmann motors.
The motors can be found in garage doors, entrance gates and other Hörmann products.
Your Homey must be connected to the same network that your Hörmann BiSecur Gateway is connected to.

To achieve the best user experience and stability, a static IP address is recommended for your Hörmann BiSecur Gateway.
This can typically be set in the settings of your router.
It is also strongly recommended to create a new user for the gateway for each motor.

Command requests are based in part on the work of skelsec: https://github.com/skelsec/pysecur3

To further improve the app, please report bugs and suggest new features on GitHub (mhaid).

Cheers!
